Track: Track A-The Causal Policy Track (Difference-in-Differences)

Paper: Card, D., & Krueger, A. B. (1994). Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

Summary: The major causal question for this article is whether a rise in the minimum wage would lead to a decrease in employment. The authors treated Pennsylvania fast food restaurants as a control group and utilized the example of $4.25 to $5.05 minimum wage raise in New Jersey to conduct research with the Difference-in-Difference strategy. The final result under multiple robustness tests indicated a positive estimated effect between the rise in the minimum wage and employment. In other words, New Jersey fast food restaurants had an increase in the level of employment by 2.67 full-time workers, which contradicted the prediction of the traditional competitive model.
